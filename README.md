## Introduction
This repository contains a series of must-do questions, daily solved problems, and concepts that I am learning as part of my preparation for various competitive exams and coding interviews. By sharing this journey publicly, I hope to help others who are also preparing for similar challenges. I will be using **`Java`** as my primary programming language for solving these problems.

## Goals
- To systematically cover and practice important DSA topics.
- To solve daily problems and improve problem-solving skills.
- To document and share useful resources and concepts.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- Daily Problems: Contains problems that I solve on a daily basis.
- Must-Do Questions: A collection of important and frequently asked DSA questions.
- Concepts: Detailed notes and explanations of various DSA concepts.

## Resources
Here are some of the resources I use for my preparation:

- LeetCode
- GeeksforGeeks
- HackerRank
- CodeChef
- CodingNinja

If you find any issues or have suggestions for new problems or concepts, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
